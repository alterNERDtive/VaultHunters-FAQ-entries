# How to Reset Corrupted Configuration Files

**For Clients (Singleplayer)**

*If your crash report mentions **`reauth.toml`**, that is not in `config`, but in the top level folder. Just delete it.*

1. Open your instance folder. On Curseforge, click the menu button (3 dots), then click “Open Folder”.
2. Rename the `config` folder and keep it around as a backup.
3. Download the latest mod pack files from <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/vault-hunters-1-18-2/files>.
4. Open the zip file you just downloaded. Navigate to the `overrides` folder.
5. Copy the `config` directory to your instance folder.

Repairing the profile (Curseforge) or “updating” to the same pack version (Prism) might work as well.

**For Servers**

Do the same thing, just in your server folder instead of your instance folder.
