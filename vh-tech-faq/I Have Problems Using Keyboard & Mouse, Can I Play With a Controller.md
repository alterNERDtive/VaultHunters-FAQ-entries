# I Have Problems Using Keyboard & Mouse, Can I Play With a Controller?

Yes, you can! There are mods that allow playing Minecraft entirely with a controller. It might not be the ideal input method, but enables players that otherwise couldn’t play to use a controller. One of those is controllable:

As the newer versions require Just Enough Items version 10+ and the pack ships with JEI 9, you will have to make sure you are using Controllable version 0.16.5: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controllable/files/3936914

**Note**: As this mod does not ship with the pack by default, it is not tested 
nor guaranteed to work without issues.
