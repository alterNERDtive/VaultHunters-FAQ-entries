# Haste Breakpoints

tl;dr:

* **+21.25**: Negate the “y-level bug” that prevents insta mining non-wooden chests when you change elevation while doing it.
* **+51.25**: Insta mine Vault Ores.

(assuming Haste 3 + Efficiency 5, _not_ including the base speed of 9)

**Y-Level Bug**

When you are falling/flying/swimming/jumping while mining, your mining speed is reduced by a factor of 5. That is a vanilla Minecraft feature to prevent you e.g. from dying to fall damage while mining straight down faster than you are falling, and to make mining underwater harder.

For non-wooden chests that fortunately means you only need a little bit of extra mining speed to still insta mine. Getting enough mining speed to do the same to Vault Ores is theoretically possible, but not feasible due to the much higher base requirements.

*Required mining speed: +21.25.*

**Insta Mine Vault Ores**

If you are using a Shatterer to mine Vault Ores, it is important that you don’t just mine the surrounding stone and leave all the ores floating, making you do a second pass to mine them.

If you have enough mining speed to instantly mine not only the stone / Vault Stone, but also the Vault Ores, you can mine everything in one go.

*Required mining speed: +51.25.*
